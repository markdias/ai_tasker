### Step 1: Initial Goal Input
You start by describing what you want to plan.

**Project Details:**
- Title: "Birthday Party - November 15"
- Description: "I want to plan a birthday party"
- Due Date: November 15, 2025

### Step 5: AI Generates Comprehensive Task List
Based on your goal and answers, ChatGPT creates a detailed, organized task list.

## Troubleshooting

### "AI questions didn't make sense"
**Solution:** Your goal description may have been too vague. Try being more specific about what you're planning.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Plan a party"
- ✅ "Plan a surprise 30th birthday party for 25 friends in December"

### "Generated tasks don't match my needs"
**Solution:** You can:
1. Edit individual tasks after creation
2. Delete tasks that don't apply
3. Add custom tasks in the project
4. Edit the project description and regenerate

### "Generated too many/too few tasks"
**Solution:** The number of tasks depends on your goal complexity. You can:
- Delete unwanted tasks after generation
- Add more specific details in your answers
- Manually add more tasks to the project

### "Due date keeps resetting"
**Solution:** Make sure you save your changes after editing the due date. The "Save Changes" button in the project detail view must be tapped.
